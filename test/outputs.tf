Based on the architecture diagram, the necessary Terraform output definitions would be:

```hcl
output "formatted_file_bucket" {
  description = "The name of the S3 bucket where the formatted file with essential inputs is uploaded"
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.formatted_file_bucket.id
}

output "summary_pdf_bucket" {
  description = "The name of the S3 bucket where the generated summary and PDF are stored"
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.summary_pdf_bucket.id
}

output "process_file_lambda" {
  description = "The ARN of the Lambda function that processes the file"
  value       = aws_lambda_function.process_file.arn
}

output "cloudwatch_log_group" {
  description = "The name of the CloudWatch log group for the Lambda function"
  value       = aws_cloudwatch_log_group.lambda_log_group.name
}
```

These output definitions provide the necessary information to access and reference the resources created by the Terraform configuration, such as the S3 bucket names, Lambda function ARN, and CloudWatch log group name.

Note that the actual resource names and types may vary depending on the specific Terraform configuration used to create these resources. The output definitions should match the resources defined in the Terraform configuration.
