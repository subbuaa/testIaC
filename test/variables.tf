Based on the architecture diagram, the following Terraform variable definitions would be necessary:

```hcl
variable "formatted_file_path" {
  description = "Path to the formatted file with essential inputs"
  type        = string
}

variable "s3_bucket_name" {
  description = "Name of the S3 bucket to upload the formatted file"
  type        = string
}

variable "lambda_function_name" {
  description = "Name of the Lambda function to process the file"
  type        = string
}

variable "cloudwatch_log_group_name" {
  description = "Name of the CloudWatch log group for Lambda function logs"
  type        = string
}
```

This covers the main components shown in the diagram:

- `formatted_file_path`: The path to the formatted file with essential inputs, which is the starting point.
- `s3_bucket_name`: The name of the S3 bucket where the formatted file will be uploaded.
- `lambda_function_name`: The name of the Lambda function that will process the uploaded file.
- `cloudwatch_log_group_name`: The name of the CloudWatch log group where the Lambda function logs will be stored.

Please note that additional variables might be required depending on the specific configuration and resources used in your Terraform setup.
